To use the sensors with the Kinect, we will be following a series of tutorials to mod the kinect to be able to connect it to a PC. 

It is possible to connect to a Mac as long as a Windows emulator is installed. 

Step 1: Purchase pre-owned (or new) Kinect Xbox One sensor. There are ways to use a 360 sensor, but I have purchased an Xbox one sensor.

Step 2: Purchase adaptor, or hack your way to one, using things you probably have laying around the house.
